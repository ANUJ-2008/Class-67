There was a crow. He was very thristy. He started searching was water but he could not find water 
anywhere. Suddenly he saw a pot of water. He was very happy to find some water. When the crow peeked 
inside the pot, he saw the water was very low. He got an idea. The crow started taking stones and 
throwing them inside the pot. In a while the water came to the brim, and the crow quenched his thrist
happily and flew away.
